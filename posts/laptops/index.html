                <h2>3. Razer Blade </h2>
                <h3>The best Blade yet</h3>
                <p><b>CPU:</b> Intel Core i7-8750H | <b>Graphics:</b> Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6 VRAM) - Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 (8GB GDDR6 VRAM) | <b>RAM:</b> 16GB | <b>Screen:</b> Up to 15.6-inch UHD (3,840 x 2,160) 60Hz touch display | <b>Storage:</b> 256GB - 512GB M.2 SSD</p>

            <div>
                <p>For a few years now, the Razer Blade has been among the best gaming laptops on the market, filled with powerful components, beautiful displays and an elegant chassis. That’s all true for the 2019 model, too, which now rocks up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080. That is, frankly, a ton of power for a laptop this thin and light. Plus, even if that’s not enough GPU horsepower for you, you can use the Razer Core for future expansion. It’s an expensive device, but it might be worth it if style and power are equally as important to you.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The best gaming laptops keep getting more expensive every day. Especially now that Nvidia RTX graphics are available, getting a powerful gaming laptop carries quite the toll. Luckily, laptops like the Lenovo Legion Y7000P are here to lighten the load. This budget-minded gaming laptop features an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, which should be just fine for its 1080p 60Hz display. When it’s a question of getting the essentials in order to save some cash, the Lenovo Legion Y7000P is a no-brainer.</p>

                <p>Some gaming laptops just don’t pull any punches, enabling you to run any game you can imagine without breaking a sweat – and the MSI GT75 Titan is one of these laptops. It’s a titanic desktop replacement packing 6-core Intel Coffee Lake processors, plenty of RAM and powerful Nvidia Pascal graphics. You’re not going to be able to carry it around with you, and it’s not going to be something you’ll be caught with in a coffee shop, but if raw power is what you’re after, look no further. Just be ready to break open your piggy bank. </p>

            <div>
                <p>Thin and light gaming laptops are everywhere right now, but if you don’t care about that, and want a thick, heavy and monstrous laptop that can demolish any game you throw at it – the Asus ROG G703GI is for you. This is a massive – and expensive – laptop, but it justifies its size and price with gaming performance that rivals the best gaming PCs. Just don’t think you’ll be able to haul it along with you to your local coffee shop without its two power bricks – or awkward stares.</p>

                <h2>7. Asus ROG Strix GL502</h2>
                <h3>It's hard not to love a gaming laptop this good</h3>

            <div>
                <p>It may not boast the most innovative design, substituting the usual black and red aesthetic for one that makes it feel like Halloween all year round (no complaints here). But, it’s undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to gaming in 1080p. In fact, we were able to crank the setting s all the way up in Overwatch without ever straying below 60fps. It doesn’t feature the longest battery life, but the screen, power and onboard sound system more than make up for it.</p>

                <p>If you’re looking for a powerful gaming laptop, and you don’t want to spring for one of those svelte thin and light gamign laptops, the Acer Predator Helios 500 is a good option. Packed with up to an Intel Core i9 processor and full-fat Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, this gaming laptop will be able to handle any game you throw at it – even if it’s not the most portable device in the world.

                <h2>9. Dell G3 15</h2>

                <p>When you’re setting out to buy one of the best gaming laptops, one of the first things you’ll likely notice is how expensive they can get. Luckily, the Dell G3 15 is not just extremely affordable, but it punches above its weight class with great 1080p gaming performance. With up to an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, you’ll be able to play all the latest games at 1080p without breaking a sweat, even if it’s not at max settings all the time. And, that blue on black color combo is quite a looker, if that’s your aesthetic. </p>

                <h2>10. Gigabyte Aero 15</h2>
                <h3>Thin. Light. Powerful.</h3>
                <p><b>CPU:</b> Intel Core i7 8750H - Intel Core i9-8950HK | <b>Graphics:</b> Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 (8GB GDDR6) - GeForce RTX 2080 (8GB GDDR6) | <b>RAM:</b>8GB – 32GB | <b>Screen:</b> 15.6-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) LCD anti-glare 144Hz - UHD (3,840 x 2,160) 60Hz | <b>Storage:</b> 1TB - 2TB NVMe SSD</p>
         
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Over the last couple of years, there’s been a trend among the best gaming laptops to make them as thin as possible. And, the Gigabyte Aero 15 definitely fits the bill, while delivering top-end gaming performance. This laptop is just 0.74 inches thick, while delivering up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 and an Intel Core i9 CPU. However, this thinness is a double-edged sword: the Core i9 gets way too hot and can throttle. So, just keep that in mind if you plan on doing any sustained creative work, like editing all your gaming videos. </p>
